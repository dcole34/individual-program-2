This repository includes three C programs showcasing synchronization techniques in multi-threaded environments. 
- `barrier.c`: Demonstrates a barrier synchronization method ensuring all threads reach a specific point before proceeding.
- `rendezvous.c`: Illustrates how two threads synchronize their execution at a particular stage.
- `fork-join.c`: Shows the fork/join pattern, where a parent thread spawns a child thread and waits for its completion.
